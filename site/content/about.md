Kontana is a free, privacy-first cash tracker built for people who prefer cash — for privacy, discipline, or savings.

## Why cash?

Many people find cash helps reduce impulse spending, improves awareness, and increases privacy. Kontana is designed for that lifestyle.

## What Kontana does

- **On-device cash log** — Track cash-in and cash-out with categories and notes.
- **No bank linking** — No account aggregation, no data brokerage.
- **Offline-first** — Works without internet. Cash doesn't need Wi-Fi.
- **Optional exports** — JSON and PDF, only when you choose.
- **Privacy by default** — No analytics, no tracking, no cloud sync.

## How it's built

- Local-first architecture: your data stays on your device.
- Open development: feedback shapes the roadmap.
- Minimal dependencies: small, fast, private.
