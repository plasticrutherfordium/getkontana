**Kontana** is a free, on-device cash tracker. No bank linking, no data brokerage — just a simple way to spend less, save more, and rely less on institutions you don't trust.

- On-device storage only
- No bank accounts required
- Free at launch

## How it works

**1. Log it**
When cash leaves your wallet, record it in seconds.

**2. Review**
See trends and categories that actually change your habits.

**3. Save**
Use cash intentionally and watch your "small spends" shrink.

────────────────────────────────

## Privacy note

Cash is private. Your tracker should be too. Kontana stores everything on your device — no cloud sync, no analytics, no third-party access. You choose what to export, and when.

## FAQ

**Is Kontana really free?**
Yes. Free at launch, no hidden fees, no premium tier planned.

**Does it connect to my bank?**
No. Kontana is cash-only by design. No bank linking, no account aggregation.

**Where is my data stored?**
On your device only. Nothing leaves your phone unless you explicitly export it.

**Can I use it offline?**
Yes. Kontana is offline-first. Cash doesn't need Wi-Fi and neither does your tracker.
