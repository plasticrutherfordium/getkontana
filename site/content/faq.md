## Is Kontana really free?

Yes. Free at launch, no hidden fees, no premium tier planned.

## Does it connect to my bank?

No. Kontana is cash-only by design. No bank linking, no account aggregation.

## Where is my data stored?

On your device only. Nothing leaves your phone unless you explicitly export it.

## Can I use it offline?

Yes. Kontana is offline-first. Cash doesn't need Wi-Fi and neither does your tracker.

## How do I get notified at launch?

Join the [waitlist](/) — email only, no tracking, unsubscribe anytime.
